A New Freedoms Start

I come from a family of the Law,
I am the savior of the weak at heart,
I fulfill the needs of those forsaken
I carry the sword of freedoms start.

My armor of silver is a symbol of righteousness,
It has righted the wrongs of many of men.
I cower to no one, for I am a warrior of peace.
I fight for freedoms start, and I shall win.

I carry a my soul on my sleeve,
It reminds me of the love of my family.
I pray that someday this will all end,
And we will all be united and free.



I fight for a new Freedoms start,
A life without the evil or the devils heart.
I fight, and defend the laws of our land,
So that our lives are not torn apart.

My armor is silver with the might of the Lord
It has been blessed by those of the land,
Do not challenge my righteous soul,
For I will bury you with this sword in my hand.

I am the Law the peace maker of the times,
I ride alone, yet, I have an army by my side.
Soon we will see a new Freedom start,
And behind this armor I will no longer hide.
